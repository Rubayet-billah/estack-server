    "instructor": "Ramsi Bolton",
    "details": "We begin our formal study of physics with an examination of kinematics, the branch of mechanics that studies motion. The word kinematics comes from a Greek term that means motion. Note that kinematics is not concerned with what causes the object to move or to change course. We will look at these considerations later in the course."
